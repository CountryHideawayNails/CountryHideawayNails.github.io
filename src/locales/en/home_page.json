    "about_paragraph": "My name is Athena Riggle, the owner and operator of Country Hideaway Nails. Before my family and I moved to the area in the summer of 2009, I often visited the many nails salons available in OKC. After moving to the country, however, I found that the nearest salon was often more than half-an-hour away. Because of this, I began performing my own nail-care services and quickly picked it up as a fun hobby. To make a long story short, I eventually decided to attain my nail technician certification, and in 2022 I opened Country Hideaway Nails: a peaceful, yet convenient salon for fellow rural American residents. I hope you'll visit soon!",
